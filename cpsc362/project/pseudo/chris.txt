At Startup:
	The program loads to a login screen or it auto logins.
	N U M B E R L A N D text appears at top.
	Colorful program appears.
	The program will show a picture and 5 buttons, "Time Attack", "Quiz", "Practice Mode", "Calculator", and "Exit".
	
Time Attack
	Once "Time Attack" is clicked a button is prompted to say "Ready to play?" and once clicked the game will start.
	The game generates random algorithmic math to be displayed in stdout.
	A countdown timer will also begin.
	The user will fill out answers at their pace.
	Once answered, it will immediately give response whether correct or incorrect.
	Timer:
		If timer goes out, stdin will stop and it will be left with "Game Over" text.
		A "+" button will appear to let the user increase time if desired to encourage critical thinking.
	The game keeps going until timer goes out or if stopped.
	
	
Practice Mode
	This will prompt the user with "Ready to play?" and once clicked the game will start.
	This is almost verbatim quiz but will NOT UPDATE POINTS OR HISTORY.
	
Quiz
	Before playing there is an extra button to display previous ranked games called "History"
	Almost a carbon copy of "Practice Mode" except that there is a max time that cannot change.
	There also is no immediate feedback.
	Once over, the game will give a report of what was correct and incorrect.
	Quiz WILL UPDATE POINTS ALGORITHM AND UPDATE HISTORY.
	
	History
		Will give a PDF of all your previous games and date.
		
Points
	Not a button.
	Text will appear at the top that gives the total rank in an algorithmic way.
	No more than 10 score. No smaller than 0.
	
Calculator
	Will create a calculator prompt at time but will auto-close during quiz.
	Buttons 0-9 and mathmatical symbols.
	
Exit
	Returns 0 and ends program

This is all I can think of at the moment. Login will use mySQL and is still being considered.
