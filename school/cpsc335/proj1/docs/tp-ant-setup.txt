TP Ant Setup
1. "Initially, the grid is all black and the Ant is in the center cell,
    heading North (toward the top)."
2. "initialize a 41 by 41 square grid to have all cells black (state 0).
    The lone Ant should be in the center cell."
TP Ant First "Move"
3. "it first notices the color of the cell it is on and then changes its
    direction/heading based on this color,"
    BEFORE Doing Any Move
4. "then 'increments' the color of the cell under it to the next color
    in sequence"
    FROM Black to The Next Color
5. "finally moves one cell in its new direction"
   Which Was Set in Step #4, Above.
Hope this helps.
